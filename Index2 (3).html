    <h1>That's Just Ducky!</h1>
    <p>Having ducks can be a lot of fun (just look at that cute little fuzzy guy!), but if you&#39;re new to owning ducks - there&#39;s a lot to learn! Take a look around this website to learn the first steps to getting a duck - hopefully this will help in your decision making process.</p>

    <h1>A few benefits></h1>
    <p>I do want to point out that owning ducks as a pet can have many benefits. 1. Duck eggs - ducks can lay 250 eggs per year. They are also more nutrient dense than a chicken egg. 2. Ducks are great foragers! If you have weeds in your yard, they will help rid of them. (But they also dig holes!) 3. Companionship- While some ducks run from their owners, others will eat right out of your hand. Mine personally hang out with us in the backyard and like to be pet. I love looking over to see them sunbathing right beside me.</p>

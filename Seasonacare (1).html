<p>It took me some research, trial and error to figure out how to care for my ducks during seasons change.</p>
<h1>Summer Care</h1>
<p>One issue that I found during the summer is the duck pine needs to be cleaned very often. If not it heats up and creates an awful stench and attracts all kinds of bugs. This is unsanitary for the ducks and especially if you eat the eggs. During this summer our ducks mostly used a kiddie pool while we were building our small pond. They eat less in the summer months but need almost around the clock access to water</p>
<h1>Winter Care</h1>
<p>I was so nervouse that my ducks would freeze this winter! To be prepared I purchased an insulated dog house - which they absolutely love! Ducks eat more in the winter to keep their fat levels up for warmth and again they needs lots of access to fresh water. Sometimes they will even go for a swim in the winter, so thankfully their pond was completed this fall. Ping pong balls helps keep the water from freezing over, although I also make sure the ice is broken on the pond and still keep their kiddy pool full</p>
<p>Ducks love things like bushes to hide under from predators and the sun or winter wind. It is important to provide your ducks with protection.</p>

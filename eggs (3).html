    <h2>How do I know if a duck egg is good?</h2>
    <p>Collecting duck eggs is easy. While it is safe to eat a fertalized egg, you probably want to get it before it is incubated (where the momma duck sits on it). I believe it's safe to say most people don't want to crack open an egg to find a half developed duck. If you are not sure if the egg has been incubated, get a flashlight and shine it through the egg. If the egg glows with bloodvesels, do not eat it. Check the table below to see how long your eggs will keep for.</p>

        <td>3 months</td>
        <td>6 weeks</td>
        <td>Do not consume</td>
    </tr>

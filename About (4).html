    <h2>We just love our ducks!</h2>
    <p>We got our ducks in March of 2021. I was in the store and on a whim decided that they would make great companions and  that they were so cute! Little did I know just how much research I would have to do when it came to raising them. Never the less, I was correct in that they make great companions. If you have any questions or want to know more about my ducks, fill out the form below.</p>
